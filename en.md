<p class="jumbo">Two modern articulated buses lay still in front of us, engines turned off, windscreens full of colourful protest stickers. Beside one of the buses stands a driver with a blank stare.</p>

A common word appears in both of their destination indicators: _UPV/EHU_, the acronym of the [University of the Basque Country][wikipediaehu]. Just in front of the buses, dozens of students seat on the asphalt, blocking the way. The crowded [Via Apia][ehustreetview] is surprisingly silent as [students peacefully protest][eldiarioehu]. Current [Bizkaibus][bizkaibus] services are, they say, expensive and of poor quality.

[Bizkaibus][bizkaibus] is the public bus network in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country. The provincial government manages and subsidises the 104 lines, run by private operators but consistently branded so that passengers do not generally notice the operating companies' existence. Ridership peaked in 2001 with 38 million passengers, then sharply decreasing in 5 year time and stabilising at 28 million ([2013 figures][wikibidaiariak]). Competition with other public transport operators is the most likely cause of this loss. But here at the campus, the choice is simple: either bus or car for students who can afford it.

<br/>
<br/>

«<span class="entry">Ah, bus drivers,</span> always thinking how to piss students off», I hear from the apparently sarcastic driver, as I settle on the front seat of the bus, where the view is much better. «You mean the strike? --I ask-- Still no settlement with the government?». It's 4 pm, I look back and see only a couple of other riders at the back seats. The bus departs. It's a perfect time to ask some questions.

«They don't want to talk. They say it's between us the workers and the operating companies--he yells, visibly annoyed--. But it's up to them. They decide how many buses to put out there, even type and capacity. They want to merge lines, to make lines less direct, longer, to reduce frequency. They are the ones who want to worsen your service!»

Bizkaibus workers are currently on strike. They demand that the authorities do not downgrade current service levels, reducing the amount of workers.

According to worker unions, at the end of last year's strike (2013), they signed an agreement with government officials that involved "sticking to current employment levels and together with that, keeping the current lines or creating new ones". Apparently, the regional government wants now to reorganise lines and service levels, unions say, "going back to the controversial 2013 plan that stated that around 300 jobs were unnecessary for a proper service".

The lines that go to the campus are too many, and very infrequent. The scheme tries to cover most populated places with their own bus line, but cannot afford to put many buses in each of these lines.

[_Be on the way_][jwalkbeonway] is a good motto when it comes to laying out a transit friendly development. The developers of the 1972 brutalist campus of Biscay in Leioa didn't have that in mind. The campus is uphill, surrounded by empty green land and no major road or railway is close enough. Transit lines have to deviate quite a few kilometres from the optimal routes or there have to be dedicated lines for university service.

The current planners have chosen the latter. And it's a fair choice. It wasn't easy to do any better. The problem is that they they chose to serve most of the potential riders with point to point lines. Currently, you can reach Bilbao with no less than 7 direct lines.

{% image {{ site.url }}/images/bizkaibus_campus_carto.jpg "The map appears to show great coverage, but it's an illusion since many lines use the motorways" %}

Besides, this map shows the shinny 5 minute headways Metro Bilbao line---marked in orange. If you are on that underground line---which has an excellent ridership levels---currently no station exists where you are guaranteed frequent service to the university.

<br/>
<br/>

<span class="entry">At peak time,</span> the lines that use the busy belt-motorway are the fastest and therefore often crowded with riders standing on the aisles of the articulated buses. While this situation may be completely normal in city streets, motorway speeds are around 80 km/h with dense traffic, making these services very vulnerable in case of accident.

In addition, peak time traffic jams are not uncommon on this motorway. All the direct Bilbao lines except the slow A2314---which does not use the motorway---are exposed to potential delays that severely disrupt the service when they happen.

The best frequency in these lines happens to be 30 minutes, with the exception of a couple of additional morning peak services in the A2318 line. This low frequency means that passengers have to plan their schedule---and one might say, professors may have to plan exam times---to _coincide_ with the timetables, as waiting in the rain for at least 30 minutes is not an acceptable perspective for anyone missing the bus. This is certainly not the seamless experience we expect from public transit, if it is to make anyone consider to leave their car parked at home.

<p class="jumbo">The story is summed up with a few words: The many lines disperse the service, and so, frequencies are low.</p>

You may go to many places without changing vehicles, only at a few pickled times though. The important point here is that the option of dispersing the service is perceived as a much better choice because, while the apparent good coverage is easy to see on a map---every centimetre of ink counts---, useful, frequent lines appear to represent a poorer service.

This is clearly the case when lines with a very poor frequency get the exact same representation than frequent ones---those that allow you to show up whenever you like and get on the bus in a few minutes.

One way to avoid this is to use a distinguishable colour scale, such as the [Brewer scale][brewer] used in the schematic maps I made for this piece. These diagrams show how the frequencies can be improved by simplifying the layout and providing connection points. The resulting frequent network diagram appears to cover less map space, but the colour (frequency) of the lines is key here. Let's apply that colour representation to the basic comparison of _direct_ versus _connective_ networks featured in a [essential Jarrett Walker article][jwalkconnect].

{% image {{ site.url }}/images/direct_vs_connective_full_en.png "The connective network allows you to show up any time you wish and have stable travel times. Based on Jarrett Walker's example." %}

At first sight, the direct network appears to do much more. However, that effect fades when we pay attention to the colour scale. Which lines are more useful? The current Bizkaibus services to the campus are the _direct network_ type. The dispersion of service means that the buses will not be there whenever you need them. You have to synchronise your schedule _with_ the bus schedule.

<span class="entry">To add fuel to the flame,</span> municipalities and the university itself could do better to support efficient public transport lines. Because shorter round-trip times reduce the operating costs of a transit line.

The university has recently opened a new [three-level parking lot][campusparking] in the campus. One that puts more weight in favour of the car, which can now be easily parked in a protected, secured place with plenty of free space. The situation is worsened by the location of the entrance to the parking lot. Just in the middle of the lane that buses take to access the campus. Every turning car now has the potential of delaying the bus and long queues have been seen in the road up to the campus.

{% image {{ site.url }}/images/campus-map.jpg "A linear campus. A great missed opportunity for transit lines with more than one stop." %}

Another source of inconvenience is the [Disneyland-like round-trip][ehustreetview] of the campus that buses have to take before opening their doors at a single stop in a long linear campus. The great number of lines departing at similar times (o'clock, and a half) means a lot of space is needed for the many buses. A great opportunity to do multiple stops along the linear Via Apia was missed. In turn, we have a weird situation where the stop you use is determined by the destination of the bus---they decided to arbitrarily group them like that---, rather than where in the campus you are going.

City councils of Bilbao and Leioa (the municipality where the campus is located) also have great opportunities to relieve the pain of these services. In Bilbao, the driver tells me, buses are not allowed to stop near the San Inazio underground station entrance. On top of that, they are forced to take a long tortuous route in San Inazio, due to the current one-way street layout.

In Leioa, the bus that takes you from the campus to the nearest underground station makes a circuitous route to serve as many neighbourhoods as it can, thus lengthening the drive to the Metro Bilbao station. A future tramway line is planned to connect the station and the campus. The project has been going on for years---even the tramway depot and most of the boulevards are built---but the project stalled due to funding problems. Nevertheless, many wonder, what does it stop both council and provincial government from using the space of the future tram to implement today a much faster bus connection?

<p class="jumbo">«We get a lot of support from you –the driver tells me, perhaps mistaking me for a student– You get the worst service and still you support our strike»</p>

Students have been protesting for a long time. They have expressed their support for the workers during the strike, while adding their demands for a quality service and cheaper fares.

«Truth is some improvements could be made. Like, perhaps, shortening and combining lines and using the extra buses to make them more frequent», I let go, as if I were waiting for some sort of reaction. But he rather insists on keeping current services or adding more buses and drivers to the existing lines.

In my opinion, the question cannot simply be reduced to a matter of more or less service. I see that the unions equate the terms _keep jobs and investment_ to _keep the current lines_. I know that merging two similar lines can be an excuse to leave the frequency unchanged and thus worsening service and laying off drivers. However, the workers' conservative stance has also proved wrong for current needs, the present set-up being unable to attract new riders.

On the other hand, if the provincial government is worried about the economical sustainability of the system, it is certain that one of their goals should be high ridership, because full buses need less subsidies than half empty ones. The problem they have is that although they may see a short term decrease in subsidies by cutting service, if passengers' needs are not met, they will respond with lower ridership in the long run. This leads us to a vicious circle where less frequency and more circuitous lines---meaning longer travel times---decreases attractiveness, therefore ridership, and lower ridership can again imply even more cuts with less frequency and you see how it goes.

Change is inevitable if the service is to persist and thrive. Funding is important but here we are now confronting design problem. And all parties implied, including unions, should be a force of change.

<span class="entry">The alternative I introduce here</span> has the goal of consolidating the university service by increasing its ridership. Increasing ridership is good to reduce the subsidies of the service---since more people are transported and more tickets sold---and to ease the _half-empty bus_ effect on off-peak times that menaces today the drivers' jobs.

My analysis is limited to the data I have been able to retrieve from actual schedules, my own timings and time estimations of current routing algorithms. I have also used the promising Transitmix tool to model the cost of the current services and my alternative proposal.

In order to increase the ridership the overall experience has to be improved both by increasing the frequency and keeping travel times short enough.

The key method here is reducing the number of lines and establishing connections between them. Reducing the number of lines allows to concentrate service on these lines, increasing their frequency and allowing for very short connections.

  <span class="cd-handle"></span>
</figure> <!-- cd-image-container -->

<span class="entry">For peak service</span>, the 16 buses used in the current scheme are reduced to 10 buses---freeing 6 buses to increase frequency in other lines---and distributed along two shorter lines. Both new, frequent lines link with the Metro Bilbao railway line running every 5 minutes. In the case of the Leioa line (on the left), a shorter route is used along the projected tramway axis. On the other hand, the San Inazio line, much shorter than the A2314, uses a much more agile connection with the San Inazio underground station but maintains the minor Asua deviation to maintain coverage in that area.

Some may be worried that using the high capacity underground service might overcrowd it with the added ridership coming from servicing the university. This is indeed something reasonable. The good part is that the peak commuting direction in the underground line is the opposite than the peak commuting direction with university users. While the first are eastbound---they approach Bilbao---, the latter are mostly westbound---they go from Bilbao to the university.

  <span class="cd-handle"></span>
</figure> <!-- cd-image-container -->

<span class="entry">All-day service is very similar</span> in the proposal. While the current scheme tries to keep too many lines and has to lower frequency to 30 or even 60 minutes, the proposal mimics the same layout as in the peak service but slightly lowering frequency. In this way, the university is connected conveniently throughout the day and is able to better accommodate the needs of any individual. They are given the freedom to choose their own schedule and just ignore when buses are going to depart.

For more details about both scenarios, you can check both [the current layout][transitmixcurr] and [the proposed layout][transitmixprop] in the Transitmix web-application. Although service hour costs are the Transitmix defaults and do not reflect reality, the computed service hours are a good approximation to compare the cost of both options. The current scheme takes around 37,500 service hours and the proposed, 25,000 (33% less). The difference can go to improve frequency to other Bizkaibus lines that are currently running with unattractive very low frequencies, meeting the unions demands of not reducing jobs or investment.

There are two prerequisites for these alternatives to happen. First and most importantly, the integration between public transit modes has to be real, meaning that riders who need to use both the underground and the bus to finish their trip should not pay more. And also, the city councils should allow for transit-ways in their streets. It doesn't have to be reserved platform in every place, yet the council should take on account the layout of the lines when deciding single direction streets or allowing turns, etc. A close cooperation between transit planner and municipality needs to happen if transit is going to be operated in optimal conditions.

<p class="jumbo">We more than often see bus routes and stop locations that reflect layers and layers of minor historical changes, rather than an effective response to current needs.</p>

Bus lines have a paradoxical aspect to them. Buses are way more flexible than trains or trams as they can adapt cheaply to new needs and modify the routes to virtually any street. But at the same time, the proximity service that buses often offer results in a remarkable resistance when it comes to moving stops.

This resistance to change should be overcome. Now and then, a transit network needs to be rethought to make it converge, in its current temporal context, to its goals. Those goals need to be revised and understood by all parties involved.

<span class="entry">Update, 30th october, 2014</span>: According to official sources, unions have reached an agreement with the provincial government and operating companies. As a consequence, [the strike has been called off][agreemnteitb]. Unions say most of their demands have been met. Still, students' demands remain to be satisfied and nobody has addressed the deficiencies explained in this piece.

When I go to the campus I often like to pay a visit to the Fine Arts faculty. The smell of acrylic paint, the opportunity to peek inside a classroom full of unfinished artwork, or just looking at the graffiti on the corridor walls is worth the time. I was always amazed at how many of those graffiti featured gore images of buses eating students, sarcastic giant bus ticket designs, etc.

During the summer holidays, fresh paint was laid over the graffiti. Suddenly every wall was clear again, maybe to become the bright canvas of new murals. But I can't help thinking, is this all they are going to get? A layer of fresh paint?
